# Tumbleweed MaXX
Unofficial installation script for MaXX Interactive Desktop on openSUSE Tubmleweed.

Tested with snapshot 20230619

## Notes
Requires another desktop environment installed to work properly. I prefer KDE but Gnome is the officially supported DE. Selecting the "Generic Desktop" workflow when installing tumbleweed currently causes png files to fail to load in rox-filer.

Setup for xscreensaver and a config file are provided in the `screensaver` folder.
